# WP Theme for Cat's Cradle Antiques

Site in progress for Cat's Cradle Antiques. This is the custom theme for the site, which I use to pull the photos from their FB Page. Each photo becomes a custom post on the site, and the pages compile and display the posts as needed. The "What's New" page displays the last x number of days of photos, and the Catalog page shows all photos ever posted.

To be added:
- Categories on the Catalog page
- Refinement of the cron job that checks for new photos (using wp-crontrol)
